# PCB-Designs
This project aims to design and develop Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for three critical systems of the Hyperloop train: the Vehicle Control Unit, the Braking System and the Power Management Circuit. 
#This project focuses on designing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for three essential subsystems of the Hyperloop train: the Braking System, the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU), and the Power Management Circuit. Given the Hyperloop’s high-speed operations, these systems must be efficient, robust, and reliable to ensure safe and seamless functionality.

The Braking System PCB will control the electromechanical braking mechanism, providing precise deceleration and emergency stop capabilities. The design will integrate high-power semiconductors like IGBTs or MOSFETs, sensor interfaces for speed and position monitoring, and redundant safety circuits to ensure reliable operation even in failure modes.

The Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) PCB will serve as the brain of the train, managing key functions like propulsion, braking, and communication with onboard and ground systems. The VCU design will feature a central processing unit (CPU), communication interfaces (CAN, Ethernet, etc.), and real-time monitoring of critical subsystems. The focus will be on optimizing processing speed, system diagnostics, and ensuring fail-safe operations.

The Power Management Circuit PCB is tasked with regulating and distributing power to all train subsystems. It will handle high-voltage power conversion, voltage regulation, and energy recovery during braking. The design will include DC-DC converters, energy storage elements, and overvoltage/overcurrent protection circuits to maintain power stability.

Each PCB will prioritize thermal management, signal integrity, and electromagnetic compatibility to meet the Hyperloop’s stringent operational demands while ensuring high system efficiency and safety.
